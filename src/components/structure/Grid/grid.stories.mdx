# Grid

## A responsive Grid component, enabling complex responsive grids using simple style props.  

This Grid component is intended to solve a number of issues that are not easily handled by conventional Flexbox approaches:

* Provide fluid, responsive grid layouts with fixed gutters;
* Support variable grid item spans;
* Use a declarative, props-based configuration;
* Declare widths and margins directly on Grid items â€” i.e. no wrappers.
* Don't use negative margins, all margins and sizing remain strictly within the layout container element.
