# About

Rubrik is an opinionated framework for building design systems.  
It builds on established libraries and best-practices to provide ready-to-use components.

Rubrik extends on the components and design principles of the `Rebass` library and `Styled System`. It is intended to be used together with `Rebass` primitives â€” such as `Box` and `Flex`.

All Rubrik components use an underlying theme, and support `variants`, the `sx` prop and all styling props defined in Styled System.
