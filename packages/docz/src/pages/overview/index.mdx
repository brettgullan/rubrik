# About

Rubrik is an opinionated framework for building design systems.  
It builds on established libraries and best-practices to provide ready-to-use components.

Rubrik extends on the components and design principles of the `Rebass` library and `Styled System`. It is intended to be used together with `Rebass` primitives â€” such as `Box` and `Flex`.

All Rubrik components use an underlying theme, and support `variants`, the `sx` prop and all styling props defined in Styled System.

## Background

Rubrik has been built to support the development of content and media rich editorial websites.


## Principles

The following principles have underpinned the development of Rubrik:

* Build on established standard and best-practices.  

* Extend, adapt and re-use, rather than re-build.  We've attempted to use best-of-breed libraries and existing components, and adapted them to fit within the Rubrik paradigm.

* Design components for multiple applications; Rubrik is not intended to be a prescriptive design system -- a la Bootstrap, Lightning or Primer.  

* Extend the concept of Design Tokens to components; provide a bounded set of options for various components that can be easily reasoned about. A good example of this are Rubrik's Button components. Four distinct button types are supported -- Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta -- together with size and colour options. However, individual themes can specify completely different styling for each Button type. 

The point is that four different button types should be sufficient for most applications. When combined with size and colour options, the resulting number of button variations multiplies quickly.


* Provide sensible defaults, allow all reasonable styling to be overridden (via themes). In addition, allow per-use customizations and overrides of all component styling.
