# Grid

A responsive Grid component, enabling complex responsive grids using simple style props.  

The Grid component is intended to solve a number of issues that are not easily handled by conventional Flexbox approaches:

* Provide fluid, responsive grid layouts with fixed gutters;
* Support variable grid item spans;
* Use a declarative, props-based configuration;
* Declare widths and margins directly on Grid items â€” i.e. no wrappers.
* Don't use negative margins, all margins and sizing remain strictly within the layout container element.

Grid uses CSS flex and the calc() function. No CSS Grids. In order to maintain maximum browser compatibility.
