import { Flex, Text } from 'rebass'
import { FullBleed } from '@rubrik/core'

<lede>A decorator component that extends a faux background for an element to the full width of the viewport.</lede>  

## Import

```javascript
import { FullBleed } from '@rubrik/core
```

## Usage

The `<FullBleed>` decorator is useful for creating alternate background bands for content components. 
By default `<FullBleed>` assumes the element being decorated is centered in the viewport.

### FullBleed vs FullWidth
`<FullBleed>` does not change the decorated component's attribures, it simply adds a faux background, using the :before pseudo-element.
`<FullWidth>` sets the size of the decorated component, forcing it to the full width of the viewport. 

  <FullBleed>
    <Text
      variant="paragon"
      color="white.0"
      bg={'brand.primary'}
      p={4}
      mx="auto"
      maxWidth="50%"
    >
      This text box has a full-bleed background.
    </Text>
  </FullBleed>
