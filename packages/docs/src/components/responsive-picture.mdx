Note: `<ResponsiveImage>` depends on `<ResponsiveProvider>` to provide an integrated solution for generating responsive images. To generate simple `<img />` elements, or to opt-out of Rubrik's responsive image handling (or to roll your own!) use the `<Image>` or `<Picture>` components from `@rubrik/core`.
