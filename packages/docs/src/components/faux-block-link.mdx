<head>Faux Block Link</head> 

<lede>A decorator component to add Faux Block Link behaviour -- typically to a card layout.</lede>  

The term "Faux Block Link" was first coined by [Ben Scott](https://twitter.com/bpscott?lang=en), while working as a Technical Lead at the BBC ... way back in 2012! 

It describes a technique that adds block-level link behaviour to some content on a page -- typically a card, pull quote or similar _block-level_ content. The beauty of this pattern is that it allows additional links within the content -- for instance a link to an author or topic page -- while the rest of the block links to the specified target.

See original example here: [Codepen](https://codepen.io/BPScott/pen/Erwan)

## Import

```javascript
import { FauxBlockLink } '@rubrik/core
```

## Usage

The `<FauxBlockLink>` component adds a link element to the children of it's target component.
