<head>FullWidth</head>

<lede>A decorator component that sets the element to the full width of the viewport.</lede>  

## Usage

The `<FullWidth>` decorator is useful for creating containers for hero images, infographics or pull quotes. 
By default `<FullWidth>` assumes the element being decorated is centered in the viewport.

### FullWidth vs FullBleed
`<FullWidth>` sets the size of the decorated component, forcing it to the full width of the viewport. 
`<FullBleed>` does not change the decorated component's attribures, it adds a faux background, using the :before pseudo-element.


<Playground>
  <FullWidth>
    <Text
      variant="paragon"
      color="white.0"
      bg={options('Color', colors, colors.Grey, {
        display: 'select',
      })}
      p={4}
      mx="auto"
      maxWidth="50%"
    >
      This element has been forced to the full width of the viewport.
    </Text>
  </FullWidth>
